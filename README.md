-----

Can a struct member be const qualified?
Ans - Yes; may be because const is not a storage class, so complete struct will be bundled and only corresponding member is marked as read only/const (const isn't actually read-only; const and volatile are used to signal their meaning to compiler)

-----

Can the data at a location be modified; location is pointed to by a struct member, And the function which is trying to do the modification operation has the struct's pointer? viz, `fn(const struct *this) {*(this->that) = 10;}`?
Ans - Yes

-----

And are braces necessary in `*(this->that)` case?
Ans - No; Arrow has highest precedence over usual de-reference operator

-----

Can a struct member be static, so that only one copy of variable exists across the struct objects?
Ans - Nope; structs are like bundled and stored in a single location (this is also how classes(cpp), structs are differentiated) and declaring a static variable means that, the variable needs to be in .BSS section. A struct object can be static and the FAQ has nothing to with this statement - provided to clear a confusion.

-----

extern are initialized?
And - Yes and to zero. Give it a thought, if extern is outside a function then it's trying to refer a global var in another file/translation unit OR if extern is inside a function then it's declared somewhere outside the function (below the function body) => global. In any of the case, extern are zeroed out.

-----

Multi line string supported?
Ans - Yes, use \ (forward slash) symbol to say that it's a multi-line string

-----

Strigizer operator?
Ans - `#define str(a) (#a)`

-----

Concatenate operator = Token-pasting operator
Ans -` #define concat(a, b) a##b`

-----

How can I assign value only to a particular member of the struct object?
Ans - Designated assignment. `struct std a = {.roll = 10,};` comma is optional. Some compilers have added another symbol in C grammar: `...{roll: 10};` In any case both refer to designated assignment concept.

-----

Can I initialise to an array index?
Ans - Designated assignment. Yes and rest all will be zeroed. `int a[] = {[10] = 7};`

-----

Logical right shift operator performs logical OR arithmetic shift?
Ans - touch: arithmetic shift will hold MSB bit and also shift but logical shift pads zeros MSBs and shifts. So, it's illogical to say logical operator as arithmetic.

-----

When will a macro in another macro gets replaced? Will nested macro be first substituted OR parent macro?
Ans - parent are replaced first then a macros in replaced text are replaced and this continues.

-----

Can I send a struct object to a function? OR Can I assign one struct object to another object to copy values?
Ans - Yes. You can send a struct object to a function OR even copy contents of one struct object to another struct object. It meets your expectations, even if the struct has a static array.

-----

How're static locals differentiated whose name is same?

-----

Can we do pointer arithmetic to function pointers?
Ans - Yes; Pointer arithmetic is usually addition or subtraction of a constant or 2 pointers. Adding an integer 1 to an integer pointer results in +4 of the older value as sizeof(int) is 4. So in our case sizeof any function pointer is 1B. 'Any' here refers to any return type, any number of args or of any type of args. So adding an integer 1 to a function pointer results in +1 value.

-----

Can we jump to 10'th line in a function directly, using function pointers and pointer arithmetic?
Ans - behavior is bit unknown as of now. But SEGFAULT chances are high!

-----

Inner most static variables retain their value?
Ans - Yes

-----

Can a struct member be volatile?
Ans - Yes hukum, for sure. volatile and const are qualifiers only, they're not storage classes And it satisfies the need that says - struct object must be bundled and stored in a single location (storage).

-----

Can a static be volatile?
Ans - Yes

-----

Can a static be const?
Ans - Yes. And static const OR const static didn't matter

-----

Can a static be extern?
Ans - No. It's not a good question if you know list of storage classes. An identifier(variable/function) can belong to a single storage class. So, you can't put an identifier in more than one storage class.

-----

What's sizeof void and *(void &)?
Ans - 1B and what's the sizeof(void *)? Same as sizeof any pointer. Pointer stores address (and can point to same typed locations - unless typecasted). Number of bits used to represent an address will be machine dependent (32b = 4B, 64b = 8B).

-----

Goto has scope?
Ans - Yes. To the function level. Any goto in the same function can be handled.

-----

Function name and goto labels collides?
Ans - No.

-----

Can we de-reference a function pointer and assign a code to it?
Ans - No. Actually don't do it. It's good to learn grammar, but grammar which we don't use is not at all needed.

-----

Can we initialize an array in the midst of a block? (flower braces and type cast)
Ans - No. assignment to expression with array type - a = (int []) {4, 5, 6}; Error note seems to be pretty explanatory.

-----

_GCC only_ - Can we use typeof (GCC extension) in other user applications?
Ans - Yes, we can use the extension in any user applications. But give it a thought, what if devops team uses clang? or  Turbo C (ðŸ˜œ ). Now your code isn't portable across compilers.

-----

### Preprocessor is most-ly find & replace right, so what if I define a macro whose name is a C keyword?

-----

How can I break from all the nested looping?
Ans - A break will break inner-most loop only. However local flags can used to check and break from every other level. As architectures support pipe-lining it'll be tedious if number of nestings are high and so number of flag checks. Instead goto (unconditional branching) can be used in a point where break from all the nesting is needed; which costs only one control hazard.

-----

Can we assign any value to a global variable?
Ans - No. Only constants, literals are allowed. I got to know it this way, a function returns some number and I initialize a global variable using that function. Thinkable and good right? No it's actually bad. If this was supposed to happen then why would I need a function called main? And some other person who tries to extend my code will repeat similar thing. Now which function must be called first? Depending upon order in which variables are initialized?

-----

Can functions return a const qualified value?
Ans - I find it useless. My understanding from this (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3541766/const-return-types-in-c#answer-3541779) is that, a function which is called many times and sometimes with same set of values, then return value will be same in the case of 'sometimes'. But I tried it using GCC, it doesn't seem to be working! So, const as a return type qualifier has no use (at least I haven't found one). Cpp gives a different meaning to this question's answer and it's out of scope for this document.

-----

I get confused when const and pointers are used together. How does it work? (am actually asking for a simple method ðŸ˜‰ )
Ans - Yes there's a simple method that I've found, and I feel that, it's actually the reason to distinguish between const-pointers stuff. Basic rule is: asterisk in a declaration helps us. Any (const) qualifier written after the * will refer to the pointer variable itself and anything before that corresponds to the data that it points to. So, `const int *a` => any data pointed to by 'a' must not be changed but, 'a' itself can point to different location. `int * const a` => yeah exactly, once 'a' starts pointing to some location, it can not point to other locations (it's a good guy and acts like alias), but data location pointed to by 'a' itself can be modified. Of course compiler will not expect that, you modify something in the case of `const int * const a` (just mentioned if you were waiting for that dopamine). Now apply same concept to double pointers. `int *const *a` => data and second dimension (cell/column) can be modified but not the row (first dimension) that it points to.

-----

What actually happens when I write two string literals separated by space? And what if one among them isn't a literal and built at run-time?
Ans - Two string literals are combined and a single literal replaces them. This doesn't happen in pre-processing stage. A string literal and a character-array can't be merged in this manner. Compiler error would pop-up and helps to fix (if done these by mistake).

-----

I see some macros with no value being assigned to them. Is there any use in doing so?
Ans - We can call these 'placeholders'. These act as compile-time switches. Unlike the macros with values, these will include/exclude a part of code while pre-processing. Good but how does it help me? They help us write bit more generic, portable code. And these are also used to guard the header-file which avoids inclusion of same header file multiple times (Search for header-guards in C).

-----

I wanted to know about function pointers. Can you brief me?
Ans - Yes. wkt Pointers are spl variables which can hold address of other variable of same type (except generic pointer; assuming not typecasted). On the same lines, function pointer can point to a function of same type. Okay, in the case of functions type is nothing but signature + return type. So to declare or allocate a function pointer we need the information on the function that it can point to. Prototype of function gives us these things along with name of the function. Data pointers declaration follows this sequence - type, asterisk, ptr name. Function pointers declaration follows this sequence - return type, asterisk and name of ptr enclosed in parenthesis, function argument type/s enclosed in parenthesis.
`ret_type (*ptr_name)(type1, type2);` Yeah, it's bit weird to have name in between the function-type. Adding a typedef at the start of line makes the variables itself as a new type. So, the following statements can declare functions in a normal way. Removing asterisk in a typedef statement makes the user-defined name a type, and a asterisk must be used to declare function pointers using this name. Name in between in the type weirdness is followed in all these cases. In Python functions can be passed as arguments to other functions or stored in an array (lists in python) and I was amazed to see the same thing in C with the function-pointers concept. Callbacks (search for it) are highly usual in a large project which is built using C lang. As a note, SEGFAULTs are a given chance when we do pointer arithmatic on function pointers.
`ptr = &fn_name` OR `ptr = fn_name` are allowed ways. And the ptr can be used as if it were a function, while making a call to the corresponding function: `ptr(args)`.


-----

Can we assign a value to a struct object apart from in declaration line?
Ans - Yes. First of all, can we assign a struct object to another? Like, will the values be directly copied to LHS object? WKT this happens right, so even the concept behind question works the same way. But assigning a flower braced value will help you get a compilation error. Typecasting is a must, so that compiler can evaluate the expression. So one of my learning from this is that, flower braces are not part of an expression (except - initialization) (atleast directly). We can actually declare a variable in the expression line itself and it makes use of parenthesis wrapping flower braces and declaration stuff inside flower braces. Projects make use of this concept; And yes these variables will be local to corresponding flower braces.
